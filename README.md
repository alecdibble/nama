## About

An open-source command line utility to supercharge your aliases. Features include alias namespacing & tab autocomplete. By having easy access to all of your aliases, you can speed up your development or devOps workflow. 


## Compatability

Currently only supports the bash shell. Other shells are going to be tested & implemented in the future.

## Installation

### Installing using NPM

```
npm install -g nama
nama-install
source ~/.bashrc
```

If you run into permissions errors, please run this command:

```
npm install -g nama --unsafe-perm=true
```

If that still gives permissions issues, please follow [this guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally) to fixing npm permissions issues. You should not need `sudo` to install this.

### Installing on Ubuntu

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential
npm install -g nama
nama-install
source ~/.bashrc
```

If you run into permissions issues, please follow [this guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally) to fixing npm permissions issues. You should not need `sudo` to install this.

### Installing on MacOS

Also, make sure your shell sources `~/.bashrc` whenever a new window terminal opens. If you are running MacOS, make sure the following line is in your `~/.bash_profile` file:

```
[ -r ~/.bashrc ] && . ~/.bashrc
```

You can easily add it by running this command:

```
echo '[ -r ~/.bashrc ] && . ~/.bashrc' >> ~/.bash_profile
```


## Cloud Sync

AliaSync is a service I created to sync & store nama aliases in the cloud. To create a free AliaSync account & enable nama sync:

```
npm install nama-sync
nama-sync
```

More information can found at the [nama-sync](https://github.com/alecdibble/nama-sync) repository.


## Usage

![Name - Namespaced Aliases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alecdibble/nama/master/docs/gif1.gif "Nama Usage")

### List all namespaces

`na`

### Create & deleting namespaces

To create a namespace:
`na c [namespace-name]` or `na create [namespace-name]`

To delete an existing namespace:
`na rm [namespace-name]` or `na delete [namespace-name]`

### Creating a new alias in a namespace

`na c [namespace] [alias] [command]` or `na create [namespace] [alias] [command]`

### Running an alias

`na [namespace] [alias]`

## Running an alias in the current console

If you want to run a command like `cd` that will affect your current console, you must use the `nac` command. Currently, the mechanism that allows the `nac` command to work makes the autocomplete situation intermittent. 

```
na c test1 gohome 'cd ~/'
nac test1 gohome
```


Please file an issue or PR if you find a potential solution to this problem.

### Reference

```
nama - namespaced aliases
       Store, quickly access, and organize
       your aliases. Auto-complete too!

na [-a] [namespace]
     (-a)            Lists all commands for all namespaces
     [namespace]     List commands for the namespace


na c [namespace]
na create [namespace]
     Creates a namespace/folder to organize your aliases
       Example:     na c utils

na c [namespace] [alias] "[command]"<-Enclosed in quotes
na create [namespace] [alias] "[command]"<-Enclosed in quotes
     Creates an alias in a namespace
       Example:     na c utils echo_info "echo 'info'"

na [namespace] [alias]
     Runs your alias
       Example: a utils echo_info

nac [namespace] [alias]
     Runs your alias in the current console
     Lets commands like cd work correctly

     Note: autocomplete work intermittently for commands
     in this mode

na rm [namespace] [alias]
na delete [namespace] [alias]
     Deletes an alias in a namespace

```

You can also use `nama` in the place of `na` for any command above.

## Limitations

### Protected namespaces

  Current, you cannot use the namespace `completion` due to the mechanics of the autocompletion script.
